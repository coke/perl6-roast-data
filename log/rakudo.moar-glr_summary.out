The 'gimme' method was an internal method used by rakudo before the Great
List Refactor.  The fact that you are seeing this message, means that you
have code that was using that unsupported rakudo internal API.

Please refactor this code using the new Iterator / Seq interface.

The 'gimme' method was an internal method used by rakudo before the Great
List Refactor.  The fact that you are seeing this message, means that you
have code that was using that unsupported rakudo internal API.

Please refactor this code using the new Iterator / Seq interface.

The 'gimme' method was an internal method used by rakudo before the Great

have code that was using that unsupported rakudo internal API.

Please refactor this code using the new Iterator / Seq interface.
